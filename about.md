#### **Experience:**

​		I am currently a junior **undergraduate student** majoring in **Automation** at the School of Control Engineering, **Northeastern University (Qinhuangdao)**. My academic performance has been consistently strong, with a GPA of **4.19/5.0** (average score **91.9**), and I was awarded the **National Scholarship** in 2021. In my current research project, I am applying **Bio-inspired Algorithms** to optimize the PID controller of magnetic levitation systems, with the aim of improving their anti-interference performance. 



#### Interests:

##### Scientific Research:

​		I have always been fascinated by **unmanned aerial vehicles**, particularly their **task planning** and **path planning** capabilities. I find it especially interesting to explore how these vehicles can navigate **through complex environments, avoiding obstacles and finding the most efficient path**. In the future, I hope to pursue further research in this area and contribute to the development of more advanced unmanned aerial vehicle technologies.

##### Hobbies:
- **Photography**: I enjoy using my camera to capture the beauty of landscapes, people, and fleeting moments that I love. (I will be updating some of my works on my personal website.)
- **Traveling**: Spending time with loved ones while experiencing different cultures and ways of life is something that I find fulfilling and always piques my curiosity.
- **Reading and watching movies**: I love stories as they allow me to immerse myself in different worlds and gain new perspectives on life. I find that they can be a powerful tool for reflection and self-discovery, and often prompt me to contemplate about life.
